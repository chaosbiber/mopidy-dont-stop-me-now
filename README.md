Mopidy - Don't stop (me) now

Small node script that prevents the tracklist from becoming empty. Works best with consume mode, with or without shuffle.

Used mechanics and code snippets from [jaedb/Iris](https://github.com/jaedb/Iris) (queue/add-uri).

## Installation

npm i
```

then modify `.env` to your needs.
